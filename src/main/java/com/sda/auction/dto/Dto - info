DTO is a pattern and it is implementation (POJO/POCO) independent.
DTO says, since each call to any remote interface is expensive, response to each call should bring as much data as possible.
So, if multiple requests are required to bring data for a particular task,
data to be brought can be combined in a DTO so that only one request can bring all the required data
